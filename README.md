System A : he buys a ticket (15 dollars) every time
System B : he buys a card (500 dollars) and a first ticket for 0.90 times the ticket price, 
then for each additional ticket he pays 0.90 times the price paid for the previous ticket.

System A : 15 * 3 = 45
System B : 500 + 15 * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90) * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90 * 0.90) * 0.90 ( = 536.5849999999999, no rounding for each ticket)

John wants to know how many times he must go to the cinema so that the final result of System B, when rounded up to the next dollar, will be cheaper than System A.

ceil(price of System B) < price of System A.

test 1 - it should return 43 for movie(500, 15, 0.9)
